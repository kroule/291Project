Step 1: Make sure you add 'upc_corpus.csv' to the project folder (It's big and I didn't want to put it in the github) you can get it from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1470dnGkFksagvOro0A10c0-NA7cxaW2W/view

Step 2: Use generate_databases.py to make all of the databases populated with random values

Then you can work on the individual A4Px.py files, there is some example code in them to modify

Remember to cite sources ect
