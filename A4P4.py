#PART (Application) 4
#Drop the index, again for all databases, created in Task 10 above and write a Python application (A4P4.py) that embeds SQL statements for executing the following queries as per the requirements in the tasks below
#Write a Python application (A4P4.py) that embeds Sql statements for executing the following query as per the requirements in the task below.
#   Q5: Considering the parts that that exist in Parts, find the quantity of parts that are not used in any other part, your query must use EXISTS.
#   Q6: Considering the parts that that exist in Parts, find the quantity of parts that are not used in any other part, your query must use NOT IN.
#Tasks:
#   Run Q5 100 times and record the average query time required for the database to answer Q5 queries using each version of table Parts.
#   Run Q6 100 times and record the average query time required for the database to answer Q6 queries using each version of table Parts.
#   Compare and contrast the values obtained from Tasks 13 and 14.
#   Define and create one INDEX with the goal of optimizing query Q6. Take note of its space cost.
#   Repeat Task 14, i.e., Run Q6 100 times and record the average query time required for the database to answer Q6 queries using each version of table Parts.
#   Compare and contrast the results obtained for Task 14 with those from Task 17. Discuss in which cases the space cost of the index seemed like a worthwhile "investment.‚Äù
